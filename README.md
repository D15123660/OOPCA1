# Instructions
My project is about a simple Solar system in a 3D version. Sun is in the middle of the map, and other planet will rotate and translate automatically. I dont have a controll butten. I dont know how to find the variable position to use like mouse pressed. So it is just very basic programm.
# Brief
I saw the galaxy OOPCA1 from last year. Think it is pretty cool. So i decided to do a Solar system. It is hard at start but when you finished what you have done, may just think that is so easy. I think my best part of my CA is the rotation and translation. use push and pop matrix to go back starting point each time and i searched the number of distance and volume to make sure it looks like the real Solar system. I also used some image to cover each planet with shape.
